Yep -- right now tintin++ just ignores such codes.  [I've heard that
VT and maybe some other clients do use it though.]  Version 2.0 may
use the telnet codes, though.

I've been told that the way the telnet codes work is this:

- send prompt
- send IACGA
- send the data from the mud

IACGA is a two-character code; you'll want to #include <arpa/telnet.h>,
and you'll find IAC and GA defined in there.  So just after you send
the prompt, send the IAC character, than the GA character, then send
the rest of the line (like "That Really did HURT !", for example).

Disclaimer: I may not know what I'm talking about -- I got this from
a friendly mud admin, Bamsemums@GrimneMUD.  Try GrimneMUD to see an
example of the IACGA protocol (gytje.pvv.unit.no 4000).  You'll want
to type 'toggle iacga' as soon as you log on -- if you use PMF and
/set replace_controls you might just able to see the IACGA go flying
by...
