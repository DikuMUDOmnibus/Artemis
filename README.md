Hi to all 

To contribute back to the world of mudders, I am submitting the complete
code and world files that have been created to make the artemis mud as it
is today. I am know that the code here will benefit many muds and I hope
that the zones and extra code that is used will be enjoyed by all. As
said, many people and many hours of love and fun have made the mud as you
will see. Not many people will be mentioned for there great code and
input, but the many have given without thought just as I have .. Gmc

Here is the complete running world of the Artemis Mud (sun.webtime.com.au
8000).

Install:
To install the code and world files, install the generic circle 3.0 mud
completely.
Then uncompress the 2 archives in the appropriate directorys that they
need to sit in.

  -The contents of source.tar will sit in Circle...../src
  -The contents of world.tar will sit in Circle..../lib/world
NOTE:: The code is a direct copy of the existing code that is running, so
the config file will have to be changed to suit your mud requirements.

enjoy
