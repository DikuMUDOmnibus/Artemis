statue Zedd~
You witness in front of yourself a grand statue of the master Zedd.
This statue depicts Zedd in a pose of contentment as he seems to 
see the surrounds of his loving town.
 
As this statue is of the life size in figure, you wonder how such
a small man can have made so big a mark on the world, with his town
Zedd Town.

Lone Street~
   You immediatly realize that the city suddenly grew darker when
you left Grubby Street and it makes you feel uncomfortable.  You hear
the sounds of what you think is a war being raged off to the west
and you wonder if it is safe to find out what's going on.
   The Intersection of First and Grubby Street is to the east and Hell's
Kitchen is to the west.

The Entrance To Hell's Kitchen~
   As you walk in, you wonder why it is so dark here... and then
you realize either that the lantern has gone out.
You sense the tremendous evil that lurks within and
decide that your personal safety is more important than exploring...
besides you can think of at least of a dozen better places you'd
rather be than in Hell's Kitchen.
   You decide that the only real exit is to Lone Street which is 
to the east.

   This  is the small dark room in which the Pet shop keeps his pets.
It is vital that this room's virtual number is exactly one larger
than the Pet Shop number.
