*   Hi to anyone concerned.  This is Raven speaking from the interior
* of a Dos editing program... and this is about my Zone, DreamPlace.
*
* Zone #  - 121
* Rooms   - 100
* Mobiles - 24
* Items   - 11
*
*   This is a Zone based around the concept of dream logic, and as such
* contains much which is downright wierd.  The PC entering it will be 
* faced with a number of wildly diverse mobs, one of the first being the
* Receptionist of DreamPlace.  This Mob is not intended to be a renting
* receptionist, but is intended to enhance the atmosphere of a hotel or,
* more specifically, some form of building, and this atmosphere enhances
* the surprise the PC experiences when, going through two double doors,
* they find themselves in a large plain.
*   The most powerful mobs in this Zone are the three Avatars, level 101
* critters in remote areas of the zone.  These are intended to keep the 
* level 45+ PC's VERY busy.  The plain itself contains many low-level mobs
* (the figments) which are easy pickings, and the forest contains quite a
* few medium-level mobs (leeches, the unicorn, sprites and dryads, etc.).
* The 20-30 level PC's are catered for by mobs such as the pegasi (both
* holy and doom), and a higher level mob is the Sandman (well, this IS a
* dream zone!).
*   Many of the mobiles in this zone are hard-hitting or unusually difficult
* to hit, but each has its own weakness (hard-hitters have bad AC and hard-
* to-hit critters don't obliterate if they so much as breathe on you).  
*   There are not many items in the Zone, but those there are, are almost
* novelty items, yet not toys.  The unicorn's horn is a good example of this.
*
*  There is, I must admit, not really all that much left to say but, have a
* look at it and decide for yourself.
* 
*  HAVE FUN, AND DREAM ON!!!!!
*  Raven.
