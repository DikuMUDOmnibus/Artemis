pentagram~
It seems that the chalk used to mark this pentagram was mixed with blood
prior to being compounded, as the pentagram smells sickly-sweet and is an
ugly red color.  The runes around it definitely look evil in nature, and
seem to twist as you look at them, almost as if they don't want to be read.
