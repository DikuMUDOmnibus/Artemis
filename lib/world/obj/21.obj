decide, hmm ?) as you realise at last Pandion has fallen in battle.  Perhaps
it was his time to go ?  You shall never know..

fountain~
Whoever carved this fountain had a sick mind.  Clearly at a loss for inspir-
-ation, the carver must have grabbed a nearby fido and gone mad - for the 
fountain itself looks almost exactly like a huge, sleeping fido.  At the base
of the fountain, as if to condone the artist, a little note is attached...

For Your Pleasure,
                   The Management, Fido Fest.
