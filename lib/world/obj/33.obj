wings wing angel~
A pair of giant white wings that looks like as if it came from an angel.
This pair of gorgeous glowing wings seems to be clipped and cut off from
the poor now flightless angel and attached to a golden clip as if to be 
worn like a cloak about your body. The wings are so huge that it looks 
like it could impede your fighting ability if worn.

This is a dark velvet cloak. Though a lustrous black on the outside, the
inside lining of the cloak is a deep blood red. This looks like a typical
cloak described in the mediaeval times as the typical cloaks worn by 
vampires.
