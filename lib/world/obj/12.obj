glass bundy rum~
There's a heavy-bottomed glass, with the Bundy Bear logo on it.
It contains a deep brown liquid, which is probably Devious' favourite
brew, Black Label Bundy. If he hasn't already drunk it, that is!

Looking closely, you can see that, yes they are real. One slipper appears
to have been made from a mini foxy, and the other, from part of a labrador.

A fine gold thread has been cunningly spun to form this ring.
Its diamond is held by a miniature dragon's claw, cunningly woven
of the same golden thread.

statue statue ice frozen scythe~
As you look closely at the figure, you realise it is not a statue.
Gazing deep into the ice, you can discern the frozen features of
a fellow adventurer. You wonder how he came to be here.
The frozen adventurer is holding a small golden plaque.
~
E
gold golden plaque~
Finely engraved words appear on the golden surface of the plaque.
Obviously engraved by an immortal hand, they read:
 
 "This adventurer was caught exploiting a bug to crash the mud.       
  Let his fate be a warning to all."
 
As you watch, the writing shimmers and moves...

tool heavy lart~
This innocent looking object consists of a metal sphere mounted
on a short wooden handle. There are a few metal studs attached to
the perimeter of the sphere, but they look harmless to you.
There is some writing on the handle of the lart.

writing handle~
Carved into the oak handle are these words:
"Danae's patented Luser Attitude Readjustment Tool"
You find yourself wondering what that means.
Why don't you find Danae and ask her what it does?
