bones~
A huge pile of bones has been stacked up, full of skulls, femurs, ribs, and
all other bones of several races.  Some of the skulls are quite small - the
bones of children.  This is where the late inhabitants dumped their 
slaughtered kin when it became too dangerous to bury them decently.  
Several skulls have a dagger-in-double-circle design scrawled on them in
blood.
